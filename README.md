# wordClassification
Linear regression was used to find a correlation between four words and to classify them as a Noun or a Verb. To be able to make computations with words it was used te word embedded vectors approach.  Word embeddings representation puts every word into a vector space.  The place of the word in vector space is based on how words are related to each other.  There are many ways to put words into vector space. In this implementation, an existing pre-trained word embeddings was used.
